    <h1>LPED-SME Machine Learning Prediction</h1>
    <h3><strong>Authors: </strong>Caio Lima Firme and Elvis Sidnei Böes</h3>
    <p>Version 3. Date: 03/18/2025</p>
    <p>In v.3, more samples representing pi interactions were added to the dataset</p>
    <p>This app uses a machine learning model (Regularized Gradient Boosting) to obtain the local LPED and SME of a molecular complex.</p>
    <p>LPED stands for Local potential energy density and it is obtained from QTAIM data.</p>
    <p>SME stands for supramolecular energy and it is the total energy of interaction in a molecular complex.</p>
    <p>A (molecular) complex is the union of two (or more) substances (molecules) held together by intermolecular interactions.</p>
    <p>In case there is just one intermolecular interaction, the local SME becomes the global SME.</p>
    <p>In order to obtain the global SME for a complex with multiple interactions:
      <ol>
        <li>Firstly obtain all local SME one by one</li>
        <li>Finally sum them up</li>
      </ol>
    <p>Or one can use the Group prediction option (see below or at the right).</p>
    </p>
    <p>Beforehand, the user needs:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>A quantum chemistry package to generate the optimized geometry of the molecular complex.</li>
      <li>Choose Merz-Singh-Kollman (MK), ChelpG or RESP scheme to obtain the corresponding atomic charges.</li>
      <li>It is recommended to use a quantum method that takes into account the dispersion correction during the optimization process.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For the prediction analysis, the user needs to:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Inform the MK (or ChelpG or RESP) atomic charges of the two atoms involved in the interatomic interaction.</li>
      <li>Inform the interatomic distance between the same interacting atoms whose atomic charges were given.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The prediction depends upon the quality of theoretical level for the optimization geometry.</p>
    <p>The prediction also depends on the quality of the atomic charge scheme used.</p>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong>the dataset was designed to place the atomic negative charge in "Atomic charge A".
    </br>One must remember this when inputing atomic charges if there are positive and negative charges involved.</p>
    <p>The dataset for the machine learning modeling was obtained from our previous works on LPED plus new data.</p>
    <p>Metrics: R2=0.861, MAE = 1.06 kcal mol-1 Bohr-3, MSE = 1.43 kcal2 mol-2 Bohr-6, and RMSE = 1.19 kcal mol-1 Bohr-3 </p>
