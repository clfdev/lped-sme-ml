This app was deployed in PythonAnywhere
The webpage address is: https://clfirme.pythonanywhere.com/

PROCEDURE FOR DEPLOYMENT OF FLASK APP IN PYTHONANYWHERE:
1) Go to Consoles and open a new console.
2) In the console, use mkdir to create the main directory (lped) and secondary directory (templates).
3) In the console, create a virtual environment using:
    i) python3 -m venv myenv
    ii) source myenv/bin/activate
4) In the console, in main directory, install flask, gunicorn using pip install.
5) Go to Files, click the main directory and upload Dataset.xlsx and app.py
6) In the secondary file, upload the index.html
7) The app.py has two important modifications:
    i) file_path = '/home/clfirme/lped/Dataset.xlsx' # at the beginning of the code
    ii) app.run(debug=True, port=5002) # at the end of the code
8) In the console, create a new file called: flask_app.wsgi 
Note: In this case, you can use NANO editor. 
    i) To open nano editor, type: nano flask_app.wsgi
    ii) A new window will open. Then copy and paste this code:
    # flask_app.wsgi
    import sys
    path = '/home/clfirme/lped' 
    if path not in sys.path:
        sys.path.append(path)
    from app import app as application
    iii) After writing your code, you can save the file by pressing:
        Ctrl + O: This will prompt you to save the file. Press Enter to confirm.
        Ctrl + X: This will exit the nano text editor.
9) In the console, in the main directory of the app (use cd to get there), type: gunicorn app:app -b 0.0.0.0:5002
Note: The console will be running. Do not press control+C because the app will fail.
Note: If requested, pip install all the modules and libraries requested by gunicorn.
Note: The messages displayed in the console are:
    i)  [98] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 22.0.0
    ii) [98] [INFO] Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:5002 (98)
    iii) [98] [INFO] Using worker: sync
    iv) [99] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 99
It means it is ok.
10) Configure Your Web App:
    i) Go to the "Web" tab on PythonAnywhere dashboard.
    ii) Click on "Add a new web app". 
    iii) Select Flask and Python 3.10 or newer.
    iv) It automatically suggests the path:  /home/clfirme/mysite/flask_app.py
    BUT changed it into: /home/clfirme/lped/app.py
Note: Make sure to configure static files and database connections in your Flask app according to PythonAnywhere's file structure.
Reload Your Web App in case you have css and/or javascript files.

Click the "Reload" button on the PythonAnywhere web tab to apply the changes and open the webpage
11) After opening the webpage, it appears the message: "Hello from Flask!" 
    It is because the PythonAnywhere replaced app.py content. 
12) Open the file app.py, delete the added content and paste the correct content for this file.
13)
